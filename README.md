# Three-body-problem

The three body problem of classical mechanics refers to a problem, where three bodies - with known mass, initial coordinates and velocities - move in each others gravitational field. In general, this leads to a differential equations which cannot be solved analytically. In this simple numeric modell I used 3 bodies, each with a mass of 1 kg, and for simplicity I chose the value of the gravitational constant to 1. Most of the times with random initial parameters the solution will be chaotic. Also quite often, it happens that 2 bodies will be bound to each other (orbiting around their center of mass), and the third party will leave the system. Rarely you can find periodic solutions as well. My modell solves the related differential equations by iteration (the equations come from Newton's law of gravitation).
